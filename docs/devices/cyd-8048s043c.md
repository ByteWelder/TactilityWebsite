# CYD 8048S043C

CYD or "Cheap Yellow Display". 

⚠️ Device does not power on with a proper USB-C to USB-C cable. Use a USB-C to USB-A cable instead.

⚠️ The touch panel resolution does not match the screen resolution straight from the store. The solution is to flash the settings to the touch driver, but Tactility doesn't include such a fix at the moment.

## Features

- ✅ SD card
- ✅ External ports (UART and I2C) - I2C Enabled on the P4 JST SH 1.0 header GPIO-17 (SDA)/GPIO-18 (SCL), UART Enabled on the same header GPIO-17 (RX)/GPIO-18 (TX).
- ⚠️ USB Mass Storage feature: Not working due to having a USB-Serial (CH340C) chip instead of using the native USB pins available on the S3 directly.
