# Features

## Graphical or headless

Tactility comes with a graphical user interface and apps, but it also works without it. You can launch apps via a touchscreen or a human interface device. You can also change how the device boots and automatically start the app that you need.

## External Apps

Build apps, put them on an SD card and run them. Use LVGL for making standardized user interfaces, or use the built-in core display driver that allows you to directly push pixels to the hardware.

## Internal Apps

Several applications are included to boost productivity. You can have an off-grid chat, use the calculator, monitor the GPIO pins, or debug a UART with the Serial Monitor app. Configuring various features such as Wi-Fi connectivity or GPS devices is easy with the built-in configuration apps.

## Simulator

Build and use the PC simulator to speed up development on Linux or Windows with WSL.

## Hardware & Drivers

Easier and safer access to low level protocols such as I2C, SPI and UART.
Driver/device abstractions for graphics, touch, keyboard, GPS and more.

## Development

Enable the "Development" feature in the settings to install and run apps from your PC to the ESP32 devices over Wi-Fi.

## Crash Reporting with QR

Privacy-conscious crash reporting: When Tactility crashes, it reboots and shows a QR code.
This QR code opens a website but doesn't send out any data to the developers. You're welcome to email the crash report, though!
