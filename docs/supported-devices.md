# Supported Devices

Any ESP32 device with a touchscreen should be able to run Tactility, because drivers can be implemented for any hardware.
Implementing drivers can take some effort, so Tactility provides support for several devices.

`LilyGo T-Deck Plus` is currently the best-supported device: all features are working and performance is great.

All implemented devices:
